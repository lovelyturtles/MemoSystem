# Memo System

I've created a web server that uses a REST API. index.html is a client that's able to make requests to the server. 

## How to Run the Code
Please log into aviary to run my server. I have also hardcoded goose in my web client so please use these steps:
1. Run server.py on a terminal with the command ```python3 server.py```
2. Open a web browser and go to ```http://localhost:8265/index.html```
3. From there, you can add and delete posts to the memo system
